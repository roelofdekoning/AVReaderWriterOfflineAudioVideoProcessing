The videoFiles 'ALL-I CANO 1539.MOV' and 'IPB CANO 1538.MOV' have been added as example files to the project to illustrate a problem, namely, that an IPB compressed file can't be copied without first decompressing and then compressing it again. A question has been asked on Stack Overflow stating this problem (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34050001/how-can-i-copy-a-h264-encoded-video-recorded-with-ipb-compression-using-avasset).
